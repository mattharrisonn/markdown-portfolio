You can add emphasis and strength like em and strong in HTML/CSS 

Enclosing asterisks or underscores adds *emphasis* with _italics_ 

Enclosing double asterisks or underscores adds **strength** with __bold__ 

The two can be *__combined__* 

Apparently an empty line is required to start a new line in markdown?
